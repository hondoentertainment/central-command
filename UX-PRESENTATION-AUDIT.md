# UX Presentation Audit — Central Command

**Date:** 2025-03-15  
**Scope:** Index, content pages (Movies, Music, Sports, Runbook), shared styles, tokens, and interaction patterns.

---

## Summary

The app has a solid base: design tokens, focus-visible styles, 44px touch targets on primary controls, and consistent content shells. The main issues are **hardcoded colors** (sidebar, primary button text) that hurt theme consistency and light mode, **duplicate `:root`** blocks that make tokens harder to maintain, and a few **spacing/alignment** details. Addressing the high-priority items will remove the most noticeable presentation gaps.

## Findings

### 1. Visual consistency

| Priority | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **High** | Sidebar uses hardcoded `#06070b` and `#0b0d12` (`.dashboard-sidebar`). Ignores theme tokens and breaks light mode. | Use `var(--bg)` and `var(--bg-elevated)` or a dedicated `--sidebar-bg` token; define in both `:root` and `html.theme-light`. |
| **Medium** | `.primary-button` and `.launch-button` use `color: #0a0a0a`. Not a token; light theme may need different contrast. | Introduce `--btn-on-primary` (e.g. `#0a0a0a` dark, light theme equivalent) and use it for button text on teal. |
| **Medium** | Focus rings use `rgba(62, 180, 165, 0.5)` in many places. Teal is repeated; changes require find-and-replace. | Add `--focus-ring` (e.g. `var(--teal)` with opacity or a single rgba) and use it for all `:focus-visible` outlines. |
| **Low** | Two separate `:root` blocks (lines ~1 and ~2172 “Senior UX refresh”). Later block overrides the first. | Consolidate into one `:root` and one `html.theme-light` so tokens live in a single place and overrides are explicit. |

### 2. Layout and alignment

| Priority | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Low** | Content pages (Movies, Music, Sports, Runbook) use the same shell and panel pattern; Movies reuses `.music-link-block` for both links. | Consider a shared class (e.g. `.content-link-block`) and keep `.music-link-block` as an alias so naming fits all content link blocks. |
| **Low** | `.content-header` uses `var(--space-4)` and `var(--radius-lg)` which are only defined in the second `:root`. | After consolidating `:root`, ensure these tokens are defined in the single `:root` (and light theme) so they always resolve. |

### 3. Interactive elements

| Priority | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **OK** | Buttons and primary links have `min-height: 44px`; `a` and `button` have `:focus-visible` styles. | No change. |
| **OK** | Icon-only controls (e.g. “More”, layout toggle) have `aria-label` or visible text. | No change. |
| **Low** | `.music-link-block__cta` has no explicit `min-height` but inherits from `.primary-button` when both classes are used. | Optional: add `min-height: 44px` to `.music-link-block__cta` so CTAs stay 44px even if used without `.primary-button`. |

### 4. States and feedback

| Priority | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **OK** | Primary and ghost buttons have hover (and ghost has disabled). Focus-visible is consistent. | No change. |
| **Low** | Empty states (e.g. spotlight, tool grid) use explicit copy and links; loading uses skeleton cards. | No change. |

### 5. Accessibility baseline

| Priority | Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **OK** | Viewport has `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0` with no `user-scalable=no`. Zoom allowed. | No change. |
| **OK** | Form inputs use `<label>` or `.visually-hidden` labels; search has “Search tools”. | No change. |
| **Medium** | Contrast: `--text-secondary` on `--bg` should be checked for WCAG AA (e.g. in both dark and “Senior UX” themes). | Run a contrast checker (e.g. DevTools or axe) on body and secondary text in light and dark; adjust `--text-secondary` if below 4.5:1 for normal text. |

## Prioritized action list

**High**

1. Replace sidebar hardcoded colors with tokens (`--bg` / `--bg-elevated` or `--sidebar-bg`) and set them for light theme.

**Medium**

2. Add `--btn-on-primary` and use it for `.primary-button` / `.launch-button` text.  
3. Add `--focus-ring` and use it for all `:focus-visible` outlines.  
4. Verify and fix contrast for `--text-secondary` on `--bg` in both themes (WCAG AA).

**Low** (done)

5. ~~Consolidate the two `:root` blocks~~ — Single `:root` and `html.theme-light` at top of `styles.css`.  
6. ~~Alias `.music-link-block`~~ — `.content-link-block` added as alias; both class names work.  
7. ~~`min-height: 44px` on link block CTAs~~ — Applied to `.music-link-block__cta` and `.content-link-block__cta`.
